# 2020
First year I got around to participating (albeit with a late start).

Decided to do all the problems in rust, which I'd gotten a bit rusty on.

Doing the problems in rust definitely slows me down (as compared to, say, Python).
But it also is fun, rust is a nice language.

In the `advent2020` folder, run solutions for a particular day (eg 08) with:

```
cargo run -- 08
```

They expect input files at hardcoded locations because I was lazy.
